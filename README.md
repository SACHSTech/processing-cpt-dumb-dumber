# CS BOWL

Welcome to CS bowl, the greatest game you will ever play, the objective of CS bowl is to win the game for your team on the last down of the game. You will control your quarterback, pick a play, and execute it. Using WASD you can move your quarterback character, using the mouse you can click wherever youd like the ball to throw to. Before the game starts there will be a route preview screen where you can select which route you would like to run. If you successfully complete a pass to a running wide receiver, and the wide receiver makes it to the endzone without being tackled, you will score a touchdown and win the game. There is no limitations to the code because the game is awesome and so are we.
